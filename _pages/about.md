About Me
======
Welcome to my personal website. I'm Antonios Gkortzis, a researcher and a software developer. This is a place where you can find information related to my research focus as a PhD candidate at the Athens University of Economics and Business and my open source software development contributions in GitHub. 
This website is under development and will soon be updated with additional material related to my research interests and artifacts. 


Website information
