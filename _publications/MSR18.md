## Abstract
Examining the different characteristics of open-source software in relation to security vulnerabilities, can provide the research community with findings that can lead to the development of more secure systems. We present a dataset where the reported vulnerabilities of 8694 open-source project versions, can be correlated with  the corresponding source code  and a number of software metrics. The metrics were obtained by analyzing the project's source code via well-established tools. Apart from commonly used metrics (e.g. loc), we also provide data related to modern development trends such as continuous integration and testing. We outline motivational examples  based on the dataset we describe.
